# Technical Specification

## Architecture
- UI: Streamlit app (`app.py`)
- Core: `diabetes_app` package with modules for config, validation, artifact loading, and prediction
- Artifacts: Joblib pickles generated by `train_model.py`

## Data Flow
1. User enters inputs in Streamlit UI
2. Inputs validated (bounds) and converted to array
3. Predictor scales and predicts using trained model
4. Results displayed with probability and breakdown

## Security
- Optional encrypted artifacts using Fernet (`MODEL_KEY`)
- Input validation via Pydantic
- TLS in transit handled by hosting provider (e.g., Streamlit Cloud)

## Testing
- Unit tests under `tests/` with coverage threshold configured in `pyproject.toml`
- CI pipeline runs lint and tests on each push/PR

## Operations
- Structured logging ready via Python `logging` (extend as needed)
- Health check can be added by a lightweight FastAPI service if required
